# landing-page

My project for https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page !

I was already familiar and rather comfortable with HTML and most of the CSS styling required for this assignment. However, I didn't know the first thing about flexbox. 

After this series of assignments and final project, I feel more comfortable with it. Now I at least know enough to ask the right questions when I get stuck!
